The visualization of SNMD is based on svg files. It is highly recommended to use `Inkscape <https://inkscape.org/>`_ to create those svg files.

.. hint::
    SNMD's color scheme is based on the `SOLARIZED <http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized>`_ palette of `Ethan Schoonover <https://github.com/altercation>`_.
    SNMD provides a GIMP palette file which can be used with Inkscape. Put the `snmd.gpl <_static/snmd.gpl>`_ into `~/.config/inkscape/palettes/` and after
    (re)starting Inkscape select the palette *Solarized & SNMD Dark`.
